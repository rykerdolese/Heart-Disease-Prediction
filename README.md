# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease, medically known as cardiovascular disease, encompasses a variety of conditions that impact the heart and blood vessels. It stands as the primary cause of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 1 in every 4 fatalities. The most prevalent form of heart disease is coronary artery disease, characterized by the accumulation of plaque in the arteries responsible for supplying blood to the heart. Other heart ailments include heart failure, irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias), and heart valve complications. Several risk factors contribute to the development of heart disease, including high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and a family history of heart disease. While heart disease presents a grave concern, adopting lifestyle changes such as regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and refraining from smoking can help prevent many cases.

Timely detection and effective management play a crucial role for individuals afflicted with cardiovascular disease or those at high risk due to factors like hypertension, diabetes, high lipid levels, or pre-existing conditions. Employing machine learning models can significantly aid in this process.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various models, simultaneously identifying the most influential factors for predicting the presence of heart disease.
